When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and formza rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long, round arch, with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries men have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. Other men have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops, which causes the rainbow. Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the water drops, where the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase. The actual primary rainbow observed is said to the effect of superposition of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the results is to give a bow with abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green lights when mixes form yellow. This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow,with little or no green or blue.
